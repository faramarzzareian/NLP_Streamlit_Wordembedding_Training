### Text Summarization Generative Model

This repository contains a Streamlit app that trains a word embedding model for text summarization using the gensim library.
## Requirements

    Python 3.x
    Streamlit
    Pandas
    Numpy
    Gensim

## Usage

    Clone the repository:

## bash

git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/text-summarization-generative-model.git

    Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

    ## Run the app:

streamlit run app.py

    In the app, upload a text file to train the word embedding model.

    The app will display the word embeddings generated by the model.

    You can also save the trained model by clicking the "Save Model" button. The model will be saved to a file named word2vec_model.
